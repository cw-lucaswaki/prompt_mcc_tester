# MCC Classification Tool Evaluation

## Context
You are creating a tool to evaluate the effectiveness of different AI agents in classifying merchants with their correct Merchant Category Codes (MCCs).

## Task
Develop a Python script that compares the performance of three different AI agents (Rafa, Matheus, and Waki) in assigning MCCs to merchants based on their names.

## Input
- A CSV file containing the following columns:
  - Merchant Name
  - Legal Name
  - Actual MCC code
  - MCC Description

## Required Functionality
1. Create an abstract base class for MCC classification agents with a standard interface
2. Implement the existing agents (Rafa and Matheus) using this interface
3. Prepare for implementation of a third agent (Waki)
4. For each merchant in the dataset:
   - Submit the merchant name to each agent
   - Compare their MCC recommendations against the actual MCC
   - Calculate performance metrics for each agent

## Output
- Generate a CSV file with columns:
  - Merchant Name
  - Legal Name
  - Actual MCC
  - MCC Description
  - Rafa's suggested MCC
  - Matheus's suggested MCC
  - Waki's suggested MCC
  - Performance metrics for each agent (accuracy, confidence score, etc.)

## Technical Requirements
- Use proper Python OOP principles (inheritance, encapsulation)
- Implement error handling and logging
- Ensure code is well-documented and follows PEP 8 standards
- Make the solution extensible for future agents

## Deliverables
1. Complete Python script implementing the above functionality
2. Sample output file demonstrating the comparison
3. Documentation explaining how to use the script and add new agents
